## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of PRISM seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Instead:

2. Include a description of the vulnerability.
3. Provide steps to reproduce (a proof of concept).

You can expect a response within 48 hours. We will perform a coordinated disclosure transition if the vulnerability is verified.

## Our Pledge

We will:
* Acknowledge receipt of your report.
* Keep you updated on the progress of the fix.
* Credit you for the discovery (if desired).
